# Two Factor Authentication (2FA) System

## Problem Description

---

**Two-factor authentication (2FA) can boost security for anyone using any kind of online service, from Google to Fortnite.**

**Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a method of establishing access to an online account or computer system that requires the user to provide two different types of information.**

**A factor in this context simply means a way to convince a computer system or online service that you are who say you are, so the system can determine if you have the rights to access the data services that you're trying to access.**
